# CAESAR CIPHER ALGORITHM
This is task 01 of prodigy 1 month summer internship june-july 2024.

**Caesar Cipher Algorithm**

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques.

In this we have to give text to encrypt or decrypt and shift value

 **ENCRYPT**
 
If i give "abc" and shift value 4, "a" will become "e" and like this for "b" and "c". so final output will be "efg".

value of "a" will be shifted by 4 and it become "e"

 **DECRYPT**

decrypt algo will also work as encrypt but in reverse if i give input "efg" and shift value 4 then,

it will decrease "e" by 4 and it will become "a" and output of "efg" will "abc".
